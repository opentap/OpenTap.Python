# Welcome to the OpenTAP Python Plugin

Python is a popular programming language for test and automation. The OpenTAP Python plugin makes it possible to use Python to program plugins for OpenTAP.

With the Python plugin you can:

- Access the OpenTAP API when creating plugins in Python. TestSteps, Instruments, DUTs, ResultListeners, and ComponentSettings can be developed in Python.
- Use your preferred programming environment, such as Python Tools for Visual Studio (PTVS) or PyCharm.
- Leverage existing Python code.
- Integrate with other OpenTAP plugins.

All other normal OpenTAP SDK constructs can be used in a similar fashion:

- Core components of the OpenTAP C# API are directly supported.
- .NET types and OpenTAP classes can be used.
- Attributes let you create user friendly configurations for your plugins.

It is highly recommended to refer to the [OpenTAP documentation](https://doc.opentap.io) for information about how to program plugins.
Most of the concepts defined there are available in a Python flavor.

It is also highly recommended to check out the [PythonExamples](http://packages.opentap.io/index.html#/?name=PythonExamples) plugin which contains sample code showing how to implement various types of plugins.
