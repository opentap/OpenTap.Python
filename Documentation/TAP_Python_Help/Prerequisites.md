# Prerequisites
The Python Plugin is available at [the OpenTAP website](https://packages.opentap.io/index.html#name=%2FPackages%2FPython). This plugin requires the following:

- **OpenTAP** version 9.19.4 or later
  - Open source development tools can be downloaded from [OpenTap.io](https://opentap.io) 
  - Commercial development tools can be downloaded from [Keysight](http://www.keysight.com/find/tap).

- **Python**
 Python 3.7 or later. Download from [python.org](http://www.python.org).

- **Supported Operating Systems**: Windows 7 or newer, Ubuntu 20.04 or equivalent or newer, MacOS 10 

Note that the platform versions of OpenTAP and Python must match: 64-bit OpenTAP with 64-bit Python; 32-bit Keysight Test Automation with 32-bit Python.
For MacOS, the Python architecture must match the dotnet architecture, so if dotnet is Apple Silicon (M1) then must Python be as well.
